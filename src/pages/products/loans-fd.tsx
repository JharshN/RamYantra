          Loans are financial instruments where a lender provides a borrower
          with a sum of money that must be repaid over time with interest. Loans
          can be used for various purposes, such as purchasing a home, funding
          education, or starting a business. They come with specific terms and
          conditions, including interest rates, repayment schedules, and
          collateral requirements.

          Fixed deposits (FDs) are financial products offered by banks and

          fixed tenure at a predetermined interest rate. FDs provide a
